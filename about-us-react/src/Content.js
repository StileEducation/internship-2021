      <p>
        We are working as full time software engineering interns at Stile
        Education in Melbourne, Australia. This internship is primarily focused
        onto getting more young women into stem, specifically software
        engineering, which is a heavily male dominated field. We will be
        learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. We
        will also be learning how to implement these languages in a live
        application as well as working collaboratively in a team of engineers
        and with external departments.

      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I graduated from John Monash Science School last year, and started here
        at Stile in March! Throughout highschool I've done a fair bit of
        programming, from working with Lego Mindstorms to dabbling in games
        development using GameMaker Studio, and finally completing Algorithmics
        (HESS) in year 12. <br />
        I currently plan on doing Software Engineering at Swinburne University
        after this year, but I am also looking at other options to enter
        directly into the industry, or study overseas in Germany. <br />
        I'm really looking forward to learning what the software industry is
        like!
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's some facts about me, but not all of them are actually true. Can
        you guess which one's the lie?
