            <h2>About the Internship</h2>
            <p>We are working as full time software engineering interns at Stile Education in Melbourne, Australia. This internship is primarily focused onto getting more young women into stem, specifically software engineering, which is a heavily male dominated field. We will be learning programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby. We will also be learning how to implement these languages in a live application as well as working collaboratively in a team of engineers and with external departments.</p>
