        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>
          I graduated from John Monash Science School last year, and started
          here at Stile in March! Throughout highschool I've done a fair bit of
          programming, from working with Lego Mindstorms to dabbling in games
          development using GameMaker Studio, and finally completing
          Algorithmics (HESS) in year 12. <br />
          I currently plan on doing Software Engineering at Swinburne University
          after this year, but I am also looking at other options to enter
          directly into the industry, or study overseas in Germany. <br />
          I'm really looking forward to learning what the software industry is
          like!

          Here's some facts about me, but not all of them are actually true. Can
          you guess which one's the lie?
